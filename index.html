    <p>
        Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of
        charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a
        common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of
        rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve
        set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population,
        lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the
        rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and
        institutions we take for granted every day.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h4><em>
                Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped
                 by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the
                  noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have
                   the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you
                    truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</em> <br> -Steve Jobs
        </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                At the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car,
                Commanders are dominant, relentless, and unforgiving.
            </li>
            <li>
                If there’s anyone Commanders respect, it’s someone who is able to stand up to
                them intellectually, who is able to act with a precision and quality equal to
                their own.
            </li>
            <li>
                Commander personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of
                others, and this helps in both their team-building efforts (since no one, no
                matter how brilliant, can do everything alone), and to keep Commanders from
                displaying too much arrogance and condescension.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class='strengths'>
        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Efficient</strong> – Commanders see inefficiency not just as a problem in its own right,
                but as something that pulls time and energy away from all their future goals, an
                elaborate sabotage consisting of irrationality and laziness. People with the
                Commander personality type will root out such behavior wherever they go.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Self-Confident</strong> – Commanders couldn’t do this if they were plagued by
                self-doubt – they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and
                believe in their capacities as leaders.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Strategic Thinkers</strong> – Commanders exemplify the difference between
                moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and
                steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every angle of a
                problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole
                project forward with their solutions.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class=weaknesses>
        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Stubborn and Dominant</strong> – Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far,
                and Commanders are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every
                single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Impatient</strong> – Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay
                to quick-thinking Commanders. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or
                disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cold and Ruthless</strong> – Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the
                merits of rationalism, especially professionally, makes Commanders incredibly
                insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities,
                and preferences as irrational and irrelevant.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class='friendships'>
        <h2>Friendships</h2>
        <h4><em>
                It’s not easy to stand up to a personality as big and blustery as Commanders’, 
                and they too often find that others crumple under the force they apply when they 
                really start to enjoy themselves.
        </em></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Commander friendships are built on ideas, and a lot of what they find enjoyable is
                the repartee of putting thoughts forward and defending them from assault from every
                angle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Only the most hardened rationalists are able to hold their ground against strongly
                expressed Commander personalities, who neither need emotional support, nor understand
                others’ need for it.
            </li>
            <li>
                More enlightened Commanders recognize that if ever there was an area where
                they could learn from others and improve themselves, it is in the realm of
                emotional sensitivity
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class='careerpaths'>
        <h2>
            Career paths
        </h2>
        <h4><em>
                For Commanders, failure is not an option – they conceive a vision of the future, 
                formulate a strategy to achieve that vision, and execute each step with ruthless
                 precision.
        </em></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                    It is in the world of careers that Commanders’ boldness and drive are truly at
                     their best. No other personality type is better suited than Commanders to be the 
                     respected leader of an organization or team, and no other personality type enjoys
                      it quite so much.
            </li>
            <li>
                    In the world of business, the sometimes overbearing level of self-confidence
                     that Commanders (especially Assertive ones) too often mishandle in their personal 
                     relationships is transformed into an admirable authority, keeping people on track 
                     and getting things done. 
            </li>
            <li>
                    Structure and order are key, and if someone gets sloppy, or holds things back
                     with incompetence, laziness or inefficiency, Commanders will not hesitate to come
                      down, hard. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class='workplacehabits'>
        <h2>
            Workplace habits
        </h2>
        <h4><em>
            Commander personality types are strident ones though, able to adapt themselves to 
            just about any hierarchical relationship by doing what they do best: asserting their 
            opinions, taking the initiative, and accomplishing feats that others thought 
            impossible.
        </em></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                    For people with the Commander personality type, the workplace is all
                     but a natural habitat. 
            </li>
            <li>
                    Subordinate positions are challenging for Commanders, and it takes active 
                    management to ensure their satisfaction and engagement.
            </li>
            <li>
                    Commanders hold themselves to very high standards, but a lot of what sets this
                     tone is feedback from their environment – namely, criticism from their managers.
            </li>
        </ul>
